The application persists user data using the browser's Local Storage, ensuring that tasks are saved and available even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

<h1>Tech stack:</h1><p>HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT</p>

<H2>Key Features:</H2>

1.Task Addition: Users can input new tasks which are then added to a task list. If the input field is empty, the application alerts the user to enter a task.

2.Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on them. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from incomplete ones.

3.Task Deletion: Each task has a delete button represented by a "Ã—" symbol, allowing users to remove tasks from the list.

4.Data Persistence: The application uses Local Storage to save the state of the task list. This ensures that the user's tasks are not lost when the page is reloaded or the browser is closed.

5.Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and works well on various device sizes.

<h3>CONCLUSION:</h3>
The To-Do List application enhances user productivity by providing a simple and efficient way to manage daily tasks. Its use of Local Storage for data persistence ensures a seamless user experience across sessions. This project demonstrates proficiency in front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and showcases the ability to create interactive and functional web applications.
